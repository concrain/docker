The container uses the bitnami/mongodb-exporter image, which exports MongoDB metrics in a format that Prometheus can scrape. The MONGODB_URI environment variable specifies the connection URL for the MongoDB server.

The mongo-exporter container is exposed on port 9216 and is mapped to the host machine. You can access the exporter's metrics by navigating to http://localhost:9216/metrics in your browser.
